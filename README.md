🛒 Amazon Clone

This is a basic Amazon-style clone built using Flutter.
The idea behind this project is to practice building a real-world e-commerce app with a clean UI, navigation, and some backend integration. Think of it as a playground to experiment with Flutter, state management, and full-stack concepts.
